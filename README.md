# Dual-View Spectral and Global Spatial Feature Fusion Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification



We designed an end-to-end dual-view spectral and global spatial feature fusion network (DSGSF)) for hyperspectral image classification. In this network, global spatial features and spectral features are extracted to learn discriminative features.  

The proposed DSGSF is a two-branch structured supervised modeling framework that efficiently learns and fuses spatial spectral features separately.

## Requirements:

The code has been tested under Python 3.9. The required packages can be installed using the following command:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To guarantee that you have the right package versions, you can use Anaconda to set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Running the  code 

The code can be run by executing python main.py. The default values of all parameters are set in the dataset.py file.

## Records:

The output of the model and evaluation results will be stored in subdirectories of results. The trained model will be saved as ''.pt" format in the model folder.
